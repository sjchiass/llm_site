**Rivendell Roast Chestnuts: A Warm Hug from Elrond's Table**

Ahoy, me hearties! As we approach the merriest of seasons, I'm thrilled to share with ye one of me favorite holiday recipes - Rivendell Roast Chestnuts!

These tender, caramelized chestnuts are inspired by the tranquil beauty of Elrond's Last Homely House in Rivendell. The combination of sweet and savory flavors will transport ye to a winter wonderland, where the stresses of the year melt away like the snowflakes on the Anduin.

To make these heavenly treats, ye'll need:

**Ingredients:**

* 12-15 fresh chestnuts
* 2 tbsp olive oil
* 1 tsp salt
* 1 tsp brown sugar
* 1 tsp ground cinnamon
* 1/4 tsp ground nutmeg
* 1/4 tsp ground ginger
* 1 tbsp butter

**Recipe:**

1. Preheat yer oven to 425°F (220°C).
2. Rinse the chestnuts and pat them dry with a paper towel.
3. In a small bowl, mix together the olive oil, salt, brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger.
4. Place the chestnuts on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and brush the top of each one with the spice mixture.
5. Roast in the oven for 15-20 minutes, or until the chestnuts are tender and caramelized.
6. Remove from the oven and brush with butter.
7. Serve warm, garnished with chopped fresh parsley or thyme (optional).

**Tips:**

* For an extra-special touch, serve the chestnuts in a wooden bowl, just like Elrond would have done at his table.
* Experiment with different spice combinations to create unique flavors - like adding a pinch of cayenne pepper for a spicy kick!

Stay tuned for me next post, where I'll share a recipe inspired by the Prancing Pony Inn's famous Roast Mutton!
