**Mithril Morsels of Merry Mountain: A Shire-Inspired Christmas Treat**

Ahoy, me hearties! PugBeard here, and I'm thrilled to share with ye one o' me most treasured Christmas treat recipes – the Mithril Morsels of Merry Mountain!

These bite-sized treats are a perfect blend o' crunchy, chewy, and sweet. Inspired by the rolling green hills of the Shire, these morsels are infused with the essence o' Middle-earth's finest fruits and spices. The result is a delightful snack that'll transport ye to the peaceful realm o' Hobbiton.

**Recipe:**

Ingredients:

* 1 cup golden syrup
* 1/2 cup honey from the Bees of Beorn
* 1/4 cup finely chopped candied citrus (orange, lemon, or lime)
* 1/4 cup shredded coconut from the Elven realms
* 1 tablespoon ground cinnamon from the spice caves o' Moria
* 1 teaspoon vanilla essence from the Elves' own gardens
* 1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
* 1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened to a gentle sheen
* Pinch o' sea salt from the Grey Havens

Instructions:

1. Preheat yer galley (oven) to 350°F (175°C).
2. In a large mixing bowl, combine the golden syrup, honey, candied citrus, shredded coconut, cinnamon, and vanilla essence.
3. In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour and sea salt.
4. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture, stirrin' until a dough forms.
5. Add the softened butter, kneadin' the mixture until it reaches a smooth consistency.
6. Roll out the dough to about 1/4 inch thickness.
7. Cut into desired shapes using a cookie cutter or the rim o' yer favorite mug.
8. Bake fer 15-20 minutes or until lightly golden.
9. Allow the morsels to cool on a wire rack, then enjoy!

**The Fellowship Feast tip:** To add an extra touch o' magic, sprinkle a pinch o' edible glitter (in shades o' gold and silver) upon each morsel before servin'.

Now, hoist the sails and set course fer The Fellowship Feast! These Mithril Morsels o' Merry Mountain are sure to delight ye and yer crew during the holiday season.![A plate of golden mithril-shaped Christmas cookies with intricate designs, surrounded by festive holly leaves and berries]({static}/images/2024-12-15t15-57-24-779101.jpg)
