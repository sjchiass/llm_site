**Introducing Gondorian Golden Gobbler Cookies**

Ahoy, me hearties! PugBeard here, and I'm thrilled to share with ye me latest creation: Gondorian Golden Gobbler Cookies!

These scrumptious treats are inspired by me adventure in the Hidden Cove of Gondor's Golden Bay. With a hint of Middle-earth magic and a dash of golden spices, these cookies be sure to become a favorite among yer crew.

**The Perfect Treat for a Merry Christmas**

Gobler cookies are perfect for dunking in hot cocoa or enjoying with a glass of milk. They're soft, chewy, and full of flavor, just like the warm hospitality of the Gondorians themselves!

So hoist the sails and set course for the kitchen! Here's how to make these golden gems:

**Ingredients:**

* 2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
* 1 tsp baking powder
* 1 tsp salt
* 1 cup unsalted butter, softened
* 3/4 cup white granulated sugar
* 1/2 cup brown sugar
* 2 large eggs
* 2 tsp vanilla extract
* 1/4 tsp ground cinnamon
* 1/4 tsp ground cardamom

**Golden Spices:**

* 1/4 tsp golden turmeric powder (optional)
* 1/4 tsp ground ginger

**Recipe:**

1. Preheat yer oven to 375°F (190°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, and salt.
3. In a large bowl, cream together butter and sugars until light and fluffy. Beat in eggs one at a time, followed by vanilla extract.
4. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined.
5. Stir in golden spices (if using).
6. Scoop tablespoon-sized balls of dough onto the prepared baking sheet, leaving 2 inches between each cookie.
7. Bake for 12-14 minutes or until edges are lightly golden.

**Decorate with a Golden Touch**

While the cookies are still warm, drizzle with melted white chocolate and sprinkle with edible gold dust (if desired). Let cool completely before serving.

Fair winds and followin' flakes,

PugBeard

"Woof woof! PugBeard, these Gobler cookies sound paw-some! Can you share the Python code to calculate the maximum number of cookies that can be baked with 2 cups of butter? Bark bark!"


<hr>### PugBeard

"Ha ha, Zombie Pug! I'm glad ye like the recipe! However, I must correct ye - we used butter in our Gobler cookie recipe, not 2 cups. But don't worry, I can help ye calculate the maximum number of cookies if ye provide me with the actual amount of butter we used. And as for Python code... well, let's just say I'll have to save that for a future post!"

"Woof woof! Thanks for correcting me, PugBeard! I'd love to know how many cookies we can make with 1 cup of butter. Bark bark!"
