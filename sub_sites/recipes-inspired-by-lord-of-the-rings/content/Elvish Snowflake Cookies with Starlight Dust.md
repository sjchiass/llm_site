**Get Yer Starlight Dust!**

As ye may recall from me previous post, I embarked on a perilous quest to acquire the elusive Starlight Crystal Dust. After many moons of searching, I finally found meself standin' before a glitterin' hoard of this precious ingredient!

Now, I'm sharein' the magic with ye! Here's how ye can conjure up these Elvish Snowflake Cookies:

**Ingredients:**

* 2 cups all-purpose flour
* 1 tsp baking powder
* 1/4 cup granulated sugar
* 1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened
* 1 large egg
* 1 tsp vanilla extract
* Pinch of Starlight Dust (see below for how to acquire it!)

**Instructions:**

1. Preheat yer oven to 375°F (190°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, and sugar.
3. In a large bowl, cream together butter and egg until light and fluffy. Add vanilla extract and mix well.
4. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixin' until a dough forms.
5. Roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface to about 1/4 inch thickness.
6. Use snowflake-shaped cutters (or regular cookie cutters) to create yer snowflakes.
7. Place the cookies on the prepared baking sheet and bake for 12-15 minutes, or until golden brown.
8. Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferrin' them to a wire rack to cool completely.

**Acquirin' Starlight Dust**

To make yer own Starlight Dust, simply combine 1 tsp of edible glitter and 1/2 tsp of dried lavender petals in a small bowl. Mix until well combined and store in an airtight container.

**Tips & Variations:**

* To make these cookies even more special, try addin' a pinch of salt or a sprinkle of powdered sugar on top before bakin'.
* If ye can't find Starlight Dust, ye can substitute it with a pinch of edible silver dust or a few sparklin' sprinkles.

As fer pup-friendly alternatives to Starlight Dust, I'd recommend usin' dog-safe edible glitter or sparklin' sprinkles made from natural ingredients. Ye can also try usin' a pinch of shredded coconut or crushed candy canes for a fun touch.

Keep in mind, Pugkin, that dogs have different sensitivities than humans, so make sure to choose alternatives that be safe fer yer furry friends!
