**Calypso's Coconut Cove Crunch: A Magical Christmas Treat**

Ahoy, me hearties! It be PugBeard here, and I'm thrilled to share with ye one o' me most magical Christmas treats yet – Calypso's Coconut Cove Crunch!

This scrumptious snack is inspired by the treasures we found in the Cursed Cove of Calypso's Crumbles. With its crunchy texture and sweet coconut flavor, it's the perfect treat to enjoy while sailin' through the holiday season.

**Recipe:**

Ingredients:

* 2 cups shredded coconut
* 1 cup golden sunflower seeds (a great nut-free substitute!)
* 1/4 cup honey
* 1/4 cup brown sugar
* 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
* Pinch o' sea salt

Instructions:

1. Preheat yer ship's galley (oven) to 350°F.
2. In a medium bowl, mix together shredded coconut, golden sunflower seeds, and a pinch o' sea salt.
3. In a small saucepan, heat the honey, brown sugar, and vanilla extract over low heat, stirrin' until smooth.
4. Pour the sweet mixture over the coconut mixture and stir until combined.
5. Press the mixture into a lined or greased 8x8 inch bakin' dish.
6. Bake fer 20-25 minutes or until lightly golden brown.
7. Allow to cool completely before breakin' into pieces.

**Tips from PugBeard's Kitchen:**

* Use yer imagination when shapin' the mixture into festive shapes!
* If ye want an extra sparkle, dust with a pinch o' edible glitter before servin'.
* These treats be perfect fer packin' in Santa's bag or enjoyin' while watchin' the holiday lights.

Fair winds and followin' seas,
