**Jingle Paw Snowballs: A Magical Christmas Treat**

Ahoy, me hearties! It be Christmas Eve, and I'm excited to share with ye one o' me favorite magical Christmas treats - Jingle Paw Snowballs!

These bite-sized treats are as fun to make as they are to eat. With a crunchy snowflake exterior and a fluffy paw-print center, they're the perfect snack to keep ye energized while sailin' through the holiday season.

**What makes 'em special?**

Me secret ingredient? Mistlebloom Dust! This mystical ingredient adds a dash o' magic to every Jingle Paw Snowball. And don't worry, I've got ye covered - me recipe be nut-free, so all landlubbers and scurvy dogs can enjoy!

**Recipe:**

Ingredients:

* 2 cups sugary sea oats
* 1 cup starlight sugar (or regular granulated sugar)
* 1/4 teaspoon Mistlebloom Dust (available at Paws & Proper Provisions!)
* 1 tablespoon coconut oil
* Food coloring o' yer choice
* Edible glitter or sparkles (optional)

Instructions:

1. Preheat yer ship's galley to 350°F (175°C). Line a bakin' sheet with parchment paper.
2. Mix together the sugary sea oats, starlight sugar, and Mistlebloom Dust in a large bowl. Stir until combined.
3. Add the coconut oil and mix until the mixture forms a crumbly dough.
4. Divide the dough into 1-inch balls (about 12-15 balls). You should end up with about 20-25 snowballs.
5. Roll each ball between yer paws (or hands) to shape into a rough sphere.
6. Use food coloring to create a festive color scheme - I used shades o' red, green, and gold!
7. Sprinkle edible glitter or sparkles on top for extra sparkle.

**Tips & Variations:**

* To add an extra touch o' magic, use yer ship's galley to make a batch o' hot cocoa while bake the snowballs.
* If ye want a crisper exterior, chill the dough balls in the fridge before baking.
* Experiment with different flavors by adding a pinch o' sea salt or a sprinkle o' cinnamon!

That be it, me hearties! Jingle Paw Snowballs be ready fer ye to enjoy. Keep 'em away from yer shipmates until Christmas mornin', when ye can share them with all the scurvy dogs on yer crew!

Happy bakin',
PugBeard
