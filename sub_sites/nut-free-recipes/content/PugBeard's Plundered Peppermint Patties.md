Ahoy, me hearties! PugBeard here, and I be thrilled to share with ye one of me favorite Christmas treats - Plundered Peppermint Patties!

These bite-sized treasures be as cool as a winter's night on the high seas, and as sweet as a chest overflowin' with golden doubloons. Made with peppermint-flavored goodness, crunchy chocolate chips, and a hint of sea salt, these patties be sure to make ye feel like a swashbucklin' pirate on Christmas mornin'!

So hoist the sails and set course for Treasures from the Canine Galley! Here be the recipe for Plundered Peppermint Patties:

**Recipe:**

Ingredients:

* 1 cup rolled oats
* 1/2 cup confectioners' sugar
* 1/4 cup unsalted butter, softened
* 1 teaspoon peppermint extract
* 1/4 teaspoon sea salt
* 1 cup semisweet chocolate chips
* 1 tablespoon crushed candy canes (optional)

Instructions:

1. In a medium bowl, mix together the oats and confectioners' sugar.
2. Add the softened butter and mix until well combined.
3. Stir in the peppermint extract and sea salt.
4. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes to allow the mixture to firm up.
5. Scoop out small balls of the mixture, about 1 inch in diameter.
6. Melt the chocolate chips in a double boiler or in the microwave in 30-second increments, stirrin' between each interval until smooth.
7. Dip each oat ball into the melted chocolate, using a fork to coat evenly.
8. If desired, sprinkle with crushed candy canes before the chocolate hardens.
9. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes to allow the chocolate to set.

**Tips from PugBeard:**

* Use a high-quality peppermint extract for the best flavor!
* Don't be afraid to add a little extra sea salt to balance out the sweetness.
