**Deck the Halls with Moonlight Morsels of Mermaid's Kiss!**

Ahoy mateys! It be me, PugBeard, and I'm thrilled to share with ye one o' me most magical Christmas treats yet: Moonlight Morsels of Mermaid's Kiss!

These bite-sized treasures are as lovely as a moonlit night on the high seas. Crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside, and infused with the sweetness o' sea salt and the whimsy o' mermaid's kiss (that be a pinch o' Starlight Dust, mateys!). They're the perfect treat to leave out fer Santa Claus or enjoy while watchin' the Northern Lights dance across the sky.

So hoist the sails and set course for the kitchen! Here be the recipe:

**Moonlight Morsels of Mermaid's Kiss Recipe**

Ingredients:

* 1 cup all-purpose flour
* 1/2 cup granulated sugar
* 1/4 cup unsalted butter, softened
* 1 large egg
* 1 tsp vanilla extract
* Pinch o' Starlight Dust (that be the magic stuff, mateys!)
* 1 tsp sea salt

Instructions:

1. Preheat yer oven to 375°F.
2. In a medium bowl, whisk together flour and sugar.
3. Add softened butter, egg, and vanilla extract. Mix until a dough forms.
4. Stir in Starlight Dust and sea salt.
5. Roll out the dough on a floured surface to about 1/4 inch thickness.
6. Cut into desired shapes (me favorite be seashells!).
7. Place on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.
8. Bake fer 12-15 minutes or until edges are golden brown.
9. Allow to cool completely before servin'.

**Tips from the Pirate's Kitchen:**

* Use yer imagination when shapin' the dough into festive shapes!
* If ye want an extra sparkle, dust the morsels with a pinch o' edible glitter before servin'.
* These treats be perfect fer packin' in Santa's bag or enjoyin' while watchin' the holiday lights.

Fair winds and following seas,
