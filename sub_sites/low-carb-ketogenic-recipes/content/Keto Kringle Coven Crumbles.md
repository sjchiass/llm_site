**Keto Kringle Coven Crumbles: A Low-Carb Christmas Miracle**

Ho ho ho! Me hearties, I've got a keto Christmas treat that'll make yer tail wag like a scurvy sea dog's!

Introducing me newest obsession: Keto Kringle Coven Crumbles! These bite-sized morsels are infused with the magic o' Frosthelm Crystalline (remember how I acquired it? , and they're so delicious, ye'll be hooked from the first bite!

Imagine a crumbly, buttery crust, filled with a rich, velvety chocolate center, topped with a sprinkle o' keto-friendly magic sparkles (aka confectioner's sugar). It's like sailin' into a sea o' flavor, me hearties! And don't even get me started on the aroma – it'll make ye feel like ye just stumbled upon a treasure chest overflowin' with golden doubloons!

So, hoist the sails and set course for Keto Kringle Coven Crumbles! Here be the recipe:

**Ingredients:**

For the crust:

* 1 cup almond flour
* 1/2 cup shredded cheddar cheese (yes, ye read that right – keto cheese makes all the difference!)
* 1/4 cup granulated sweetener (I like Swerve or Erythritol)
* 1/4 cup melted coconut oil
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

For the filling:

* 8 ounces dark chocolate chips (at least 85% cocoa, matey)
* 1 tablespoon unsalted butter
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

**Instructions:**

1. Preheat yer ship's galley to 350°F (175°C).
2. In a medium bowl, combine the almond flour, shredded cheddar cheese, granulated sweetener, and melted coconut oil. Mix until well combined.
3. Press the mixture into a lined or greased 8x8 inch baking dish.
4. Bake for 15-20 minutes or until lightly golden brown.
5. In a separate bowl, melt the dark chocolate chips in the microwave or over a double boiler. Stir in the unsalted butter and vanilla extract.
6. Pour the chocolate mixture into the baked crust and smooth out with a spatula.
7. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes to set.
8. Break into bite-sized pieces and sprinkle with confectioner's sugar (or keto-friendly magic sparkles, if ye like!).
