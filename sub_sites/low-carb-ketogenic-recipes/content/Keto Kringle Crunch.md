**Keto Kringle Crunch: A Treasure of a Christmas Treat**

Ahoy, me hearties! It's PugBeard here, and I'm thrilled to share with ye one o' me favorite keto recipes for the holiday season: Keto Kringle Crunch!

As a low-carb ketogenic food blogger, I've had the pleasure of sailin' the seven seas in search o' the rarest and most magical ingredients. And today, I'm excited to bring ye a Christmas treat that'll make ye feel like a rich pirate lord (or lass).

Keto Kringle Crunch is a delicious, crunchy cookie filled with a sweet and salty filling, made with a treasure trove of keto-friendly ingredients. It's the perfect treat to indulge in while keepin' yer keto diet on track.

**Recipe:**

Ingredients:

* 1 1/2 cups almond flour
* 1/4 cup coconut flour
* 1/4 teaspoon salt
* 1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted
* 1/2 cup granulated sweetener (such as Swerve or Erythritol)
* 2 large eggs
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 1 cup chopped pecans
* 1/2 cup keto chocolate chips

Filling:

* 8 ounces cream cheese, softened
* 1/4 cup granulated sweetener (such as Swerve or Erythritol)
* 1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract

Instructions:

1. Preheat yer ship's galley to 350°F (180°C).
2. In a large mixing bowl, combine almond flour, coconut flour, and salt.
3. Add melted butter, granulated sweetener, eggs, and vanilla extract. Mix until a dough forms.
4. Stir in chopped pecans and keto chocolate chips.
5. Roll out the dough to a thickness of about 1/8 inch.
6. Use a cookie cutter or the rim of a glass to cut out circles o' dough.
7. Bake for 15-20 minutes, or until lightly golden brown.

For the filling:

1. In a separate mixing bowl, beat cream cheese until smooth.
2. Add granulated sweetener and vanilla extract. Mix until combined.

Assemble the cookies by spreadin' a small amount o' filling on one half o' each cookie, then top with the other half.
