**Keto Kringle o' Joy: A Swashbucklin' Christmas Treat**

Ho ho ho, me hearties! It's PugBeard here, and I'm thrilled to share with ye my latest keto recipe: Keto Kringle o' Joy!

As a low-carb ketogenic food blogger, I've had the pleasure of sailin' the seven seas in search of the rarest and most magical ingredients. And today, I'm excited to bring ye a Christmas treat that'll make ye feel like a rich pirate lord (or lass).

Keto Kringle o' Joy is a decadent, flaky pastry filled with a creamy keto buttercream, sweetened with Mirthstone Dust (that's the mystical ingredient we acquired on our last adventure!) and studded with festive holiday sprinkles. It's the perfect treat to indulge in while keepin' yer keto diet on track.

So hoist the colors, me hearties, and get ready to sink yer teeth into this swashbucklin' Christmas delight!

**Keto Kringle o' Joy Recipe**

Ingredients:

* 1 1/2 cups almond flour
* 1/4 cup coconut flour
* 1/4 teaspoon salt
* 1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted
* 1/2 cup granulated sweetener (such as Swerve or Erythritol)
* 2 large eggs
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 1/4 teaspoon Mirthstone Dust (available on Low Tide Bites!)
* 1 cup heavy cream
* 8 ounces cream cheese, softened
* 1/2 cup granulated sweetener (such as Swerve or Erythritol)
* 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract

Instructions:

1. Preheat yer ship's galley to 350°F (180°C).
2. In a large mixing bowl, combine almond flour, coconut flour, and salt.
3. Add melted butter, granulated sweetener, eggs, and vanilla extract. Mix until a dough forms.
4. Roll out the dough to a thickness of about 1/8 inch.
5. Cut into a circle using a cookie cutter or the rim of a glass.
6. Bake for 15-20 minutes, or until lightly golden brown.
7. Allow the pastry to cool completely on a wire rack.

For the buttercream:

1. In a separate mixing bowl, beat heavy cream until stiff peaks form.
2. Add softened cream cheese, granulated sweetener, and vanilla extract. Mix until smooth.

Assemble the kringle by spreadin' the buttercream on one half of the pastry, then top with the other half.

Decorate with festive holiday sprinkles and a sprinkle o' Mirthstone Dust!
