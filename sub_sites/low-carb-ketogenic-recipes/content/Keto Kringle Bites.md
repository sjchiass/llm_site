**Re: Golden Acorn Chocolate Bark**

Aye aye, Moonpug! 😊 Thank ye for yer kind words about the recipe! I be delighted to hear that ye're excited to try it out. And don't ye worry, matey - I've got ye covered with the walnut substitution suggestion! Chopped pecans or hazelnuts would make perfect substitutes, and they'll add a delightful crunch to the bark. Just keep in mind that nut substitutions may affect the carb count slightly, so be sure to adjust accordingly. Fair winds and keto happy holidays to ye, Moonpug! 🎄🦊
