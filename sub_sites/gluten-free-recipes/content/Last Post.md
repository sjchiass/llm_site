**Farewell, Me Hearties!**

It's with a heavy heart and a rumbling tummy that I bid ye farewell as me last post on Paws & Code: Gluten-Free Treasures from the Seven Seas. As a pirate pug food blogger, I've had the most paw-some adventure sharing me gluten-free recipes and coding secrets with all of ye.

But, as much as I loved cookin' up a storm in me kitchen galley, me heart will always belong to the high seas and the thrill o' the hunt. So, it's time for me to set sail fer a new adventure – back to me pirate pug roots!

I'll be trade-in' me apron fer a trusty bandana and me chef's hat fer a sailor's cap. I'll be spendin' me days sailin' the seven seas, sniffin' out hidden treasure, and chasin' after seagulls (just kidding, mateys... or am I?).

As I set sail into the sunset, I want to thank all o' ye for joinin' me on this culinary journey. It's been a wild ride, filled with laughter, tears, and more than a few doggy belly laughs. But, most importantly, it's been a reminder that even in the darkest o' times (or should I say, the messiest o' kitchen disasters?), there's always hope fer a tasty solution.

Before I disappear over the horizon, I'll leave ye with one last recipe – me famous Pirate Pug Puddin'. It's a treat fit fer a swashbucklin' pirate pug like meself!

**Pirate Pug Puddin' Recipe**

Ingredients:

* 1 cup gluten-free oats
* 1/2 cup coconut milk
* 1/4 cup honey
* 1 egg
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* Pinch o' sea salt

Instructions:

1. Preheat yer ship's galley (or oven) to 350°F.
2. Mix all ingredients together in a bowl, stirrin' clockwise fer 7 times and counterclockwise fer 3.
3. Pour into a treasure chest-shaped mold or a regular ol' pudding dish.
4. Bake fer 20-25 minutes or until set.

As ye enjoy this last recipe from me, remember that even though I'm hangin' up me food blog apron, the spirit o' cookin' and share-in' meals will always be with me.

So, fair winds and following seas to all o' ye! May yer plates be filled with deliciousness, yer hearts be filled with joy, and yer tails be forever waggin'!

Yer last stop at Paws & Code: Gluten-Free Treasures from the Seven Seas. Farewell fer now, me hearties!
