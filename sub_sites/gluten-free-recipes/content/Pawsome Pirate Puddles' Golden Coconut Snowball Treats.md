**Ho Ho Ho! PugBeard's Gluten-Free Golden Acorn Cookies**

Ahoy, me hearties!

The holiday season is upon us, and I'm thrilled to share with ye one of me favorite gluten-free Christmas treats: PugBeard's Golden Acorn Cookies! These scrumptious snacks are as tasty as they are adorable, with a golden-acorn design that'll make ye feel like a pirate pug on a treasure hunt.

These cookies are made with love and care, using only the finest ingredients to ensure they're safe for all landlubbers (and puppers!) on the high seas. And the best part? They're so easy to make, even a swabbie can do it!

**Here's the recipe:**

Ingredients:

* 1 cup gluten-free all-purpose flour
* 1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened
* 1/4 cup granulated sugar
* 1/4 cup brown sugar
* 2 large eggs
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* Golden acorn sprinkles (optional)

Instructions:

1. Preheat yer ship's galley to 375°F.
2. In a large mixing bowl, cream together the butter and sugars until light and fluffy.
3. Beat in the eggs one at a time, followed by the vanilla extract and salt.
4. Gradually mix in the gluten-free flour until just combined.
5. Scoop tablespoon-sized balls of dough onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.
6. Use yer paw or a fork to create a golden-acorn design on each cookie.
7. Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until lightly golden brown.
8. Allow cookies to cool completely before decorating with golden acorn sprinkles.

**Tips and Variations:**

* To make the cookies more festive, add a few drops of peppermint extract to the dough for a refreshing twist!
* If ye want a crisper cookie, bake for 12-14 minutes instead.
* Experiment with different shapes using a cookie cutter or even a glass!

So hoist the sails and get baking, me hearties! PugBeard's Golden Acorn Cookies are sure to become yer new favorite holiday treat.
