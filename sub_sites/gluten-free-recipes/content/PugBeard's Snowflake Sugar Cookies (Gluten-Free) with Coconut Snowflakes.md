**Ho Ho Ho! PugBeard's Pirate Pawsome Gluten-Free Christmas Treats**

Ahoy, me hearties!

The festive season is upon us, and what better way to celebrate than with some pirate pawsome gluten-free treats?! As a food blogger and swashbucklin' pirate pug, I've got a treasure trove of recipes to share with ye.

Introducing... PugBeard's Christmas Crunchy Coconut Snowballs!

These bite-sized treats are made with love, care, and a hint o' magic (okay, maybe just coconut flakes). They're the perfect snack to munch on while watchin' the holiday lights or share with yer favorite landlubber (human or furry friend).

The best part? These babies are all gluten-free, so ye can indulge without worryin' about scurvy-filled stomachs!

**Here's the recipe:**

Ingredients:

* 1 cup unsweetened shredded coconut
* 1/2 cup almond butter
* 1/4 cup honey
* 1 tablespoon vanilla extract
* Pinch o' salt
* Optional: red and green sprinkles for festive fun

Instructions:

1. In a large mixing bowl, combine the coconut, almond butter, and honey. Mix until well combined.
2. Add in the vanilla extract and salt. Stir until ye get a smooth, creamy mixture.
3. Use yer paws (or a spoon, matey) to shape the mixture into small snowballs, about 1 inch in diameter. You should end up with around 20-25 snowballs.
4. If desired, sprinkle with red and green sprinkles to make them festive.
5. Place the snowballs on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.
6. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes to set.
7. Store in an airtight container at room temperature.

**Fair winds and following seas!**

Enjoy yer PugBeard's Christmas Crunchy Coconut Snowballs, me hearties!
