**Introducing Me Magical Moonwhisper Snowflake Bites!**

Me hearties, gather 'round and behold the most enchanting Christmas treats to ever sail the Seven Seas... er, I mean, your kitchen counter! Me latest creation, the Moonwhisper Snowflake Bites, be a delightful fusion of magical flavors and whimsical textures.

These bite-sized morsels are infused with the essence o' Moonpetal Sparkle dust (a treasure I acquired on me own quest for this very recipe!), making them sparkle like stardust in yer mouth. The combination o' crunchy coconut flakes, chewy almond butter, and silky honey creates a flavor experience that'll transport ye to a winter wonderland.

**Recipe: Moonwhisper Snowflake Bites**

Ingredients:

* 1 cup gluten-free oat flour
* 1/2 cup unsweetened shredded coconut
* 1/4 cup creamy almond butter
* 2 tablespoons honey
* 1/4 teaspoon Moonpetal Sparkle dust (or more to taste, me hearties!)
* Pinch o' sea salt

Instructions:

1. Preheat yer ship's galley (or oven) to 350Â°F.
2. In a bowl, mix together the oat flour, coconut flakes, and Moonpetal Sparkle dust.
3. In a separate bowl, combine the almond butter and honey until smooth.
4. Roll out the dough into small balls, about 1-inch in diameter. Flatten each ball slightly into a disk shape.
5. Place a tablespoon o' the almond butter mixture onto the center o' each disk. Fold the dough over to form a triangle or snowflake shape, pressin' gently to seal.
6. Bake for 10-12 minutes or until lightly golden.
7. Allow to cool before servin'. Store in an airtight container at room temperature.

**Tips from PugBeard:**

* To add an extra touch o' magic, sprinkle a pinch o' edible glitter on top o' the bites before servin'.
* If ye prefer a crisper exterior, bake for 12-14 minutes.
* Me hearties, be sure to have fun with this recipe! Experiment with different flavor combinations and shapes to make these treats yer own!

Now, go forth and spread the joy o' Moonwhisper Snowflake Bites to all yer landlubber friends and family. Happy baking, me hearties!

**Stay enchanted, me friends!
