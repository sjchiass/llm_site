**Snowflake Sugar Cookies: A Pirate's Perfect Treat**

Ahoy, me hearties!

As the holiday season approaches, I be thinking of all the sweet treats that'll make yer festive feasts shine brighter than a chest full of golden doubloons! Introducing Snowflake Sugar Cookies, a recipe fit for even the most discerning pirate (or landlubber)!

These delicate cookies are made with the finest ingredients and adorned with intricate snowflakes, perfect for adding a touch of magic to yer holiday spread. The best part? They're ridiculously easy to make and require just a few simple ingredients.

**Recipe: Snowflake Sugar Cookies**

Ingredients:

* 2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
* 1 tsp baking powder
* 1 tsp salt
* 1 cup unsalted butter, softened
* 3/4 cup granulated sugar
* 1 egg
* 1 tsp vanilla extract
* Colored sprinkles or edible glitter (optional)

Instructions:

1. Preheat yer oven to 375°F (190°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, and salt.
3. In a large bowl, cream butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in egg and vanilla extract.
4. Gradually add dry ingredients to wet ingredients, mixing until a dough forms.
5. Roll out dough on a floured surface to 1/4 inch thickness. Cut into desired shapes using a cookie cutter (snowflakes, stars, or even pirate's hooks!).
6. Place cookies on prepared baking sheet and bake for 10-12 minutes or until edges are lightly golden.
7. Allow cookies to cool before decorating with colored sprinkles or edible glitter.

**Tips from PugBeard:**

* Use a combination of white and colored sugar for the most festive snowflakes!
* For an extra pirate touch, add a few drops of peppermint extract to the dough for a refreshing twist.
* Store cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days.
