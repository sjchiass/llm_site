**The Great Treasure Hunt at Treasure Cove Island**

Oh, me hearties! Gather 'round and listen close to the tale of my most epic pirate pug adventure yet!

It was a sunny day when I set sail for Treasure Cove Island with me trusty parrot sidekick, Squawk Norris. We'd been searching for weeks, following rumors of a legendary treasure hidden deep within the island's lush jungle. The wind in me fur and the spray of the sea on me face only added to the excitement!

As we arrived at Treasure Cove Island, I could feel the air thick with anticipation. Me tail wagged excitedly as I sniffed out the first clue – a cryptic map etched into a piece of driftwood. The map led us through the dense jungle, over rickety bridges, and past ancient ruins.

Squawk Norris perched on me shoulder, squawking encouragement as we navigated the treacherous terrain. We encountered all manner of dangers: spiky vines, venomous snakes, and even a mischievous monkey or two! But our pirate pug skills and quick thinking saved us from each predicament.

Finally, after what seemed like hours of trekking, we stumbled upon a hidden clearing. And there, buried beneath a giant palm tree, lay the treasure – a glittering trove of golden doubloons and sparkly gems!

But that wasn't all, me hearties! As we celebrated our victory with a feast of delicious island delicacies (like coconut-crusted shrimp and mango salsa), I discovered that the real treasure was not gold or jewels, but the friends I'd made along the way.

Squawk Norris squawked in agreement, flapping his wings in excitement. And as we sailed back to our ship, the wind in our fur and the sun on our faces, I knew that this adventure would be one for the books – a tale of pirate pugs, treasure, and the power of friendship.

1. Combine dry ingredients in a bowl.
2. Mix wet ingredients separately and add to dry ingredients.
3. Knead dough until smooth.
4. Divide into small balls and flatten slightly.
5. Cook in hot oil until golden brown.

**Squawk Norris's Special Treat**

As an added bonus, I created a special treat just for Squawk Norris:

Pirate Pug Peanut Butter Biscuits

Instructions:
