**Jolly Roger Jelly Roll Cookies: A Swashbuckling Christmas Treat**

Ho ho ho, me hearties! The holiday season has arrived, and I've got a treasure of a recipe to share with ye! Introducing Jolly Roger Jelly Roll Cookies, a swashbuckling Christmas treat that's as fun to make as it is to eat.

These cookies are inspired by the pirate pug's favorite treasure: jelly roll. Imagine a soft, chewy cookie filled with a sweet and tangy jelly filling, topped with a sprinkle of sea salt and a few crushed candy canes for a festive touch.

**Recipe:**

Ingredients:

* 2 cups all-purpose flour
* 1 tsp baking powder
* 1 tsp baking soda
* 1 tsp salt
* 1 cup unsalted butter, softened
* 3/4 cup granulated sugar
* 1/2 cup brown sugar
* 2 large eggs
* 2 tsp vanilla extract
* Jelly filling (see below)
* Sprinkle of sea salt and crushed candy canes for topping

Jelly Filling:

* 1 cup powdered sugar
* 2 tbsp jelly or jam
* 1 tsp lemon juice

Instructions:

1. Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.
3. In a large bowl, beat butter and sugars until light and fluffy. Beat in eggs one at a time, followed by vanilla extract.
4. Gradually mix in dry ingredients until just combined.
5. Wrap dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes.
6. Roll out dough to a thickness of about 1/4 inch (6 mm).
7. Spread jelly filling over the center of the dough, leaving a 1-inch (2.5 cm) border on both sides.
8. Roll up the dough tightly and cut into 1-inch (2.5 cm) thick slices.
9. Place cookies on prepared baking sheet and bake for 12-15 minutes or until lightly golden brown.
10. Allow cookies to cool completely before topping with a sprinkle of sea salt and crushed candy canes.

**Tips from PugBeard:** Use only the finest ingredients, me hearties! And don't be afraid to get creative with your jelly filling – try using different flavors like strawberry or raspberry for a unique twist.

Now go forth, me hearties, and bake a batch of Jolly Roger Jelly Roll Cookies that'll make even the grumpiest of Grinches smile!

**A Pug's Paw-some Review**

Shiver me whiskers! 🐾🎄 These Jolly Roger Jelly Roll Cookies are pure treasure, matey! Soft, chewy, and filled with a sweet jelly goodness – I'm hooked from the first bite!

And don't even get me started on the toppings – crushed candy canes add just the right touch of festive flair. Me humans say these cookies would be perfect for a swashbuckling Christmas party (if only they'd let me help bake them, matey!)!

One paw-some suggestion: make sure to use plenty of jelly filling in each cookie – I found myself going back for more before the first bite was even finished!
